When it comes to university education abroad, the first countries that come to mind are America, Canada, England, Germany and recently Poland.

One of the most important reasons expressed by most students is the opportunity to live abroad while receiving a modern university education.

    The biggest advantage of students who will receive university education abroad is that they have the opportunity to study in the department of their choice in many countries without the pressure of exams. Students can be accepted to the department they are interested in and want, with the grades they have received throughout their education, their social projects, volunteer services, and the talents and skills they have developed, without having to take a compulsory and one-time exam. Another of the biggest advantages of studying at a university abroad is to effectively master the foreign language. is to have learned. In addition, students who study at a university abroad have the opportunity to learn other languages ​​in the country they visit. In this case, students acquire important language skills that they can use in their business and social lives.
    
    While students receive university education abroad, in some countries they do not have to take a preparatory program plus a 4-year university education, as in Turkey. Instead, students can receive a university education within a 3-year period. In this case, it is preferred for many students. While students later have the opportunity to specialize in the continuation of their university education with master's, certificate or diploma programs, they can enter business life more professionally 1 year earlier than other students. Students who receive both shorter and lower-cost education can also go to schools with YÖK accreditation and continue their business life without any problems when they return to Turkey. Even though university education abroad varies from country to country, it is often not more expensive than in Turkey. While students have the opportunity to specialize in a language, live and do an internship in a country abroad, they have the opportunity to do this at the same costs as in Turkey. That's why the majority of students keep universities abroad at the top of their education preferences. Because the education structure and cost of many universities abroad, which have YÖK equivalence and accept students without examination, are no different from the schools in Turkey.
